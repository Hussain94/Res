      <p><em>Founder of <strong><a href="https://hushyy.com/">Hushyy.com</a><strong></em></p>

      <p>I am a multimedia marketing specialst. I completed an LLB from the University of Leeds.<br>
        I am also a web developer who has worked on many projects and with many startups in the United States.<br>
        Programming is a passion I developed by accident. After taking an introductory Computer Science course, I<br>
        began to explore the tech world more extensively. The deeper I got into learning, the more my interest grew in programming.<br>
        I was fortunate to have people around me who accomplished Software Engineers who encouraged and pushed me to get better. My<br>
        due dilligence and long hours practicing along with their uncondtional support got me to where I am today. My proficiencies<br>
        include programming in python as well as knowledge in languages such as HTML, Javascript and CSS, In addition<br>
        to using frameworks such as Flask and React. This was an expirmental site to test my knowledge, I hope to look back and<br>
        see how far I've come throughout my tech journey.</p></td>
